A Beat Saber mod that adds hand/finger tracking support for OpenXR.

## Usage (for developers)
This mod simply allows the Unity.XR.Hands package to work with Beat Saber. Usage is identical to that of the package. You can take a look at [the package's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.1/manual/index.html) and the sample provided in the package itself for details on how to use it. You should not need to reference this mod directly.
